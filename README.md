# unit-01-game-project
This is my unit 1 game project for General Assembly.
I built this game as a turn-based JRPG, because of my love and passion for the genre.
It's also my first project in general, and I really used this project to test my understanding of the material I learned so far.

### Technologies Used
I used basic HTML, CSS, and JS to make this project since that is all I know so far.

### Directions
Just like a turn based rpg, you must defeat you enemy while simultaneously trying to prevent your own demise.
Make sure you wait for the text to ask you what to do next before you attempt to attack.

### Bugs
There is a bug with the new enemy health bar where it doesnt load until you attack.

### Future Endeavers
I will likely attempt to add some animations and sounds to the characters and try to fix my bugs. 

### What I Learned
I stuggled with figuring out the scope of my functions and knowing where to put each function, but eventually I did figure it out and although my code is a bit sloppy, I must say I did pretty good for my first project.
