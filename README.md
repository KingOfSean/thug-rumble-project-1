# unit-01-game-project
This is my unit 1 game project for General Assembly.

I built this game as a turn-based JRPG, because of my love and passion for the genre.

I used a learning code style to try to build this game with the knowledge I currently possess.

no frameworks were used for this game.

no API's were used for this game.

I would have liked to have added some animations, do some management things with my turn phases and buttons, and if there was a simpler way of writing my code, I would have done that to.

I stuggled with figuring out the scope of my functions and knowing where to put each function.
